# üèô Cap-It-All!

A clean and interactive quiz application designed to test and improve your knowledge of capital cities around the world. This project was built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About The Project

Cap-It-All! is a fun, front-end project created to practice and demonstrate core web development skills. The goal was to build a user-friendly and visually appealing quiz from the ground up, focusing on clean code, DOM manipulation, and a smooth user experience.

The quiz presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions and provides a summary of their performance upon completion.

### Key Features

* **Interactive Quiz:** Engages users with 15 multiple-choice questions.
* **Score Tracking:** Automatically calculates and displays the user's final score.
* **Progress Bar:** Visually indicates how many questions have been answered.
* **Clean & Responsive UI:** A simple and intuitive interface that works well on different screen sizes.
* **Restart Functionality:** Allows users to easily restart the quiz from the results screen to try for a better score.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to run this project.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/P-dilasha-004/cap-it-all.git](https://github.com/P-dilasha-004/cap-it-all.git)

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future versions of the project:

* **Use a Public API for Data:** Replace the local question set by fetching data from a free public API like [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/). This would provide a much larger and more dynamic variety of questions.
* **Implement Difficulty Levels:** Introduce "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" modes that could introduce a timer for answering or feature less common countries to increase the challenge.
